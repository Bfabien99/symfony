## MVC

# Model
Manages the fundamental behaviors and data
Interacts with the request from input fields
Respond to instructions
Notify observers in event-driven systems

# View
Interface of your application
Pull data from database, translate it into the view

# Controller
Take HTTP requests & gets the right data
Validates user input
Send responses back to the user

DO NOT
Use the View or Controller in your Model
No SQL inside your controller, let alone views
